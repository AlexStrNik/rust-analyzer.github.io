Commit: commit:aaa6961aa6d19b405dd2e837a09ac96ed6ace995[] +
Release: release:2020-03-23[]

== New Features

* pr:3582[] fetch appropriate value of `OUT_DIR` from `cargo check`.
  This enables rust-analyzer to work correctly with crates which use compile-time code generation. This might significantly slow-down startup time (as we need to run `cargo check` build), so this functionality is disabled by default.
  To enable, set:
+
[source,json]
----
"rust-analyzer.cargoFeatures.loadOutDirsFromCheck": true
----
* pr:3580[] macro expander is now more tolerant for syntax errors, which makes code completion inside macros more robust.
* pr:3623[] **Fill Match Arms** assist now works even if some arms are already present.
* pr:3607[] and instructions for installing rust-analyzer from AUR.
* pr:3640[], pr:3651[] assist to merge imports with a common prefix.

* pr:3662[] correctly part arbitrary enum discriminants.
* pr:3663[] installation from source uses `rust-analyzer` from `$PATH` by default.
* pr:3677[] include `macro_rules!` macros in workspace symbols.

== Fixes

* pr:3541[] correctly complete constants and paths in patterns.
* pr:3668[] don't suggest **Invert If** assist for `if let` syntax.
* pr:3671[] fix infinite loop in macro expansion during completion.
* pr:3674[] use correct name for the library if it is renamed in Cargo.toml.
* pr:3673[] guard against runaway macro expansion in expressions.
* pr:3681[] only suggest machine-applicable suggestions from `cargo check`.
* pr:3678[] fix rename behavior in macros.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3584[] use `dyn Trait` when working with salsa database, which improves compile times in release mode.
* pr:3606[], pr:3608[], pr:3610[] improve audit on CI.
* pr:3614[] in the TypeScript extension, be more explicit about persistent state.
* pr:3626[] check trailing whitespace on CI.
* pr:3629[] simplify and streamline plugin auto-update.

* pr:3656[] simplify arena API.
* pr:3672[] assists documentation generator skips hidden files.
* pr:3632[] log errors from `cargo check`.
