Commit: commit:a30129be5ae8fd3dc698cc035339ed651b30de02[] +
Release: release:2020-01-13[]

We now publish binary releases to GitHub üéÅ!
Note that this is the first release, so things are expected to go wrong.
Release process is orchestrated by https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/ab6e992c8719ed58c66309c5274f8a13807e6afa/.github/workflows/release.yaml[this workflow].

Additionally, the VS Code extension is renamed to `rust-analyzer` (the old name was `ra-lsp`).
`cargo xtask install` should automatically remove the old extension, but, if you use the binary release, you'd have to uninstall manually.

We also got a new sponsor: https://freiheit.com[freiheit.com]!
If you use rust-analyzer at work, consider asking your company to support its development!
