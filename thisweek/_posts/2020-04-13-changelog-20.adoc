Release: release:2020-04-13[]

== New Features

* pr:3875[] new release strategy: we now just promote Sunday's nightly to stable.
* pr:3899[] enables semantic highlighting by default.
* pr:3706[], pr:3884[], pr:3938[] show native rust-analyzer's diagnostics for not exhaustive patterns.
  As a reminder, all rust-analyzer diagnostics can be disabled with `"rust-analyzer.diagnostics.enable"` setting.
* pr:3925[] **Reorder record fields** assist to sort the fields in the declaration order.

* pr:3902[] improve documentation for Sublime Text.
* pr:3880[], pr:3918[] process cfg attributes on fields and methods.
* pr:3901[], pr:3910[] add more heuristics for hiding obvious param hints.
* pr:3905[] handle patterns with ellipsis.
* pr:3935[] generated trait methods now use `todo!` rather than `unimplemented!`.

== Fixes

* pr:3933[] fix accidentally quadratic behavior when expanding the `include!` macro.
* pr:3868[] fix panic in Chalk.
* pr:3872[] fix `"rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command"` option.
* pr:3878[] when completing a macro call, don't add `()` if they are already there.
* pr:3892[] fix "parser is stuck" error during macro expansion.
* pr:3912[] fix parsing of where clauses with `Fn` traits.
* pr:3939[] canonicalize paths coming from `cargo metadata`.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3944[] speed up type inference by up to 30% percent.
* pr:3867[] add `CI` checks for stray `eprintln`s.
* pr:3842[], pr:3906[], pr:3920[] copy libprocmacro from rustc.
  We will be using this library to load proc macro dynamic libraries.
* pr:3863[] use `.rast` extension for serialized syntax trees in tests.
  This adds syntax highlighting!
* pr:3876[] rename `complete_scope` to hopefully less confusing `complete_unqualified_path`.
* pr:3882[] centralize the logic for computing missing struct fields.
* pr:3826[] when doing syntax highlighting, produce a flat list of ranges.
* pr:3909[] generate token accessors.
* pr:3913[] remove allocation from the "least common ancestor" algorithm.
* pr:3915[] format generated code in a more readable way.
* pr:3917[] improve `tt::Subtree` debug print.
* pr:3748[] implement Chalk's debug methods using TLS.
* pr:3926[] align tokens names with `syn` somewhat.
* pr:3940[] use `actions-rs` for `cargo audit`.
* pr:3942[] more precise typing of TypeScript config.
* pr:3949[] cleanup cfg handling.
* pr:3951[], pr:3955[] simplify and unify grammar for record literals and patterns.
