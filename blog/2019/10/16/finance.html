<h1>Cost of rust-analyzer</h1>
<p>In this post, we’ll talk about financial side of the rust-analyzer project.
The goal is to find out how much rust-analyzer costs now, formulate financial goals for speeding up the development and document the <a href="https://opencollective.com/rust-analyzer/">Open Collective</a> expenses policy.</p>

<p>Note that “rust-analyzer” here refers to the umbrella project of “making great Rust IDE from first-principles”, and not to the specific rust-analyzer binary.
The long term plan is to merge all of rustc, rls and rust-analyzer into a single tool, and there are already some first steps in this direction.</p>

<p>At the moment, the de-facto project lead is me, <a href="https://opencollective.com/rust-analyzer/">@matklad</a>.
I do both engineering tasks (code, design, mentoring) as well as project-management tasks (like writing this post).
I am employed by Ferrous Systems, and dedicate half of my time to rust-analyzer.
No one else at Ferrous is involved in rust-analyzer on a daily basis, but I do occasionally ask other folks for help in non-coding areas.
Most notably, processing of open-collective donations needs help from a professional accountant.
I would estimate this additional load on Ferrous as roughly two work days per month.</p>

<p>If we take 4500 EUR as a base monthly salary (this is roughly the Blue Card level salary for Berlin), the cost of rust-analyzer for Ferrous Systems would be</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>4500 * 0.5            my work
+ 4500 * (2 / 20)     work of other folks at Ferrous
= 2700 EUR / Month
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If I were to work full time, the cost would be</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>4500 + 4500 * (2 / 20) = 4950 EUR / Month
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is a large number of  absolutely awesome contributors to rust-analyzer, not employed by Ferrous Systems!
It would be fair to reward their work as well.
It’s unclear exactly how rewarding should work like, but I would like to allocate at least 20% of the budget for payouts to people not affiliated with Ferrous Systems or Mozilla.
The current scheme for payouts is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contributors who make recurring, significant changes, influence design and co-maintain subsystems are eligible for payouts</li>
  <li>the exact conditions are discussed on the case by case bases</li>
  <li>the decision requires consensus from <a href="https://github.com/matklad/">@matklad</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matklad/">@flodiebold</a>, <a href="https://github.com/skade/">@skade</a> and the contributor</li>
  <li>the final arrangement is made public</li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest weakness of this scheme is that the decision quorum is not well-balanced.
We hope to overcome this issue by being transparent and tweaking the descision process if it doesn’t work well.</p>

<p>We also need to pay taxes from the money we receive via Open Collective.
The VAT is 19%, but donations from EU-based companies are exempt from VAT.
Additionally, total transaction processing fee (Open Collective + Stripe) is 8%;</p>

<p>So, the final formula for the yearly budget looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(cost * 10/8 payouts * 119/100 VAT * 108/100 transaction fee) * 12
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pluggin the costs from above, we get the following budget targets:</p>

<p><strong>52050 EUR / Year</strong>: I dedicate half of my time for rust-analyzer, 20% of the budget is spend funding people outside of Ferrous Systems.</p>

<p><strong>95245 EUR / Year</strong>: I work on rust-analyzer full-time (yay!), 20% of the budget is spend funding people outside of Ferrous Systems.</p>

<p>We are currently at 22280 EUR / Year, which is a good start (and roughly pays for one quarter of my time)! The work on rust-analyzer up to this point was sponsored by Mozilla and Ferrous Systems.</p>

<p>The road map for the next year is not ready yet.
It will be published by the end of October.
The preliminary plan is to focus on library-ification of two areas of the compiler: type system and parsing.</p>

If you are finding rust-analyzer useful in your work, consider talking to management about sponsoring rust-analyzer.
We are specifically seeking sponsorship from companies that use Rust!</p>
